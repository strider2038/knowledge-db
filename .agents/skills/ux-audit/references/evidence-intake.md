## The evidence log

Keep a running list as you go. It costs nothing and it is what makes §Scope of
the report honest:

```
SEEN
  /checkout/cart          live, Chrome 1440×900, logged in, 2 items    2026-08-01
  /checkout/payment       live, same session — card form only, saved-card path untried
  CartRow.tsx:12-88       code
  Figma 214:3901          "Checkout / empty" frame

NOT SEEN
  /checkout/confirmation  couldn't reach — needs a real payment
  mobile viewport         no device access, no responsive screenshots provided
  error states            not reproducible without a failing backend
```

Two rules make it useful:
- **Record the conditions**, not just the URL. Viewport, auth state, data state,
  locale. A screen with three rows and a screen with three hundred are different
  screens, and most state-coverage findings live in that gap.
- **Write the NOT SEEN column as you discover it**, not at the end. It becomes
  §1 "what was not audited" verbatim, and it's the section people skip when
  they reconstruct it from memory.

## Source 1 — live product

The strongest evidence. A finding from a running product can be `Observed` at
full confidence, and it's the only source that shows timing, focus order, and
real error behavior.

**Drive it deliberately, not just look at it.** A pass that only loads pages
misses most of the spine:

| Do this | Reveals |
|---|---|
| Complete the core task end to end, counting steps and fields | D1, D3, D4 |
| Complete it **again**, on the return-visit path | D1 (does onboarding repeat?), D7 (first-use vs power-use) |
| Tab through every interactive element from the top | D12 focus order, focus visibility, keyboard traps |
| Submit every form empty, then with one bad field | D4 validation timing, D6 recovery, D8 error copy |
| Trigger the destructive action and stop at the confirmation | D6 guards, D15 irreversibility |
| Throttle the network, then go offline mid-task | D5 loading, D7 offline, D14 perceived performance |
| Resize from widest to 320px, or open the responsive emulator | D13 |
| Empty the data (new account, cleared filters, search with no results) | D7 empty states |
| Overflow the data (long name, 200 rows, huge number, long translation) | D7 overflow, D11 truncation |
| Zoom the browser to 200% and set the OS font size large | D12 reflow, D13 |
| Toggle OS dark mode and `prefers-reduced-motion` | D9, D12 |

**Recording the evidence:** quote exact labels and error strings. Note the URL
and the state. When something is timing-dependent ("the spinner runs ~4s with no
message"), say roughly how long and on what connection.

**Limitations to state honestly:** you are one user on one device with one data
set. You cannot see: real drop-off rates, whether *your* confusion generalizes,
performance on the devices their users actually own, or anything behind a
paywall, a real payment, or a role you don't have. Those become **Open
questions**, not findings.

---

## Source 2 — design files (Figma via MCP)

Second-strongest, with one structural caveat: **a design file shows intent, not
what shipped.** A finding sourced only from Figma is `Observed` about the design
and `Inferred` about the product. Say which you mean.

### The four tools and what each is for

| Tool | Returns | Audit use |
|---|---|---|
| `get_screenshot` | A rendered image of a node | Visual hierarchy, layout, density, scan path, contrast candidates (D9, D12) |
| `get_variable_defs` | The variables/tokens bound in the selection | **The single best design-system-drift signal** (D10) — what's a token vs a raw value |
| `get_design_context` | Structured description of a node: layers, text, layout, styles | Copy verbatim, spacing values, component names, hierarchy (D8, D9, D10) |
| `get_metadata` | The node tree — names, types, ids, sizes | Mapping the file, finding the frames worth reading, resolving `nodeId`s |

**Order that works:** `get_metadata` on the file or page to see what exists →
pick the frames that match the audit scope → `get_screenshot` for the visual
read → `get_design_context` on the specific node for exact copy and values →
`get_variable_defs` on the same node for token adherence.

### Known limitations — plan around these, don't fight them

- **Screenshot reliability degrades over a long session.** Base64 image returns
  get less reliable the longer the conversation runs. When a screenshot comes
  back empty, truncated, or malformed, **do not retry it three times** — fall
  back to `get_design_context` with a **specific `nodeId`**, which returns the
  structure as text and stays reliable. You lose the visual read; you keep the
  copy, the spacing, and the token bindings.
- **Always pass a specific `nodeId` once you have one.** Whole-file or
  whole-page calls return too much, cost a lot, and are the calls most likely to
  fail. `get_metadata` first exists to get you that id.
- **Figma CDN assets are not fetchable with `curl`.** Image fills and exported
  asset URLs from a Figma file are signed and short-lived — a shell fetch gets a
  403 or an empty body. Use the MCP tools' own output; don't build a workflow
  that shells out for images.
- **A design file is not a state inventory.** Most Figma files contain the happy
  path and, if you're lucky, an empty state. Absence of an error frame in Figma
  is **not** evidence that the product lacks an error state — it's a question for
  the team. This is the single most common way a Figma-only audit produces false
  findings.
- **Naming ≠ implementation.** A layer named `Button/Primary` may or may not be
  the shipped component. Component *drift* findings need either the code or the
  live product to confirm.
- **Interactions and prototype flows are partial.** Step order from a prototype
  is `Inferred` unless the user confirms it matches the build.

### What Figma is uniquely good for

Design-system consistency (D10). `get_variable_defs` across several frames tells
you immediately whether spacing, color, and type are bound to variables or typed
in by hand — and a raw `#3B82F6` sitting next to `color/brand/primary` in the
same frame is a token-drift finding with an exact location.

---

## Source 3 — screenshots & recordings

Reliable for exactly what's in frame, and nothing else.

- **Read what's actually there.** Quote the labels. Note the viewport if it's
  inferable (browser chrome, device frame). Note the data state.
- **Never extrapolate past the crop.** "The nav presumably continues below" is
  not evidence. If the screenshot cuts off, the finding is scoped to what's
  visible or it's a question.
- **A recording is stronger than a screenshot** because it carries timing and
  sequence: how long the spinner ran, whether the layout shifted after load,
  what the user had to do twice. Watch for those specifically — they're D5, D14,
  and D3 evidence you cannot get from stills.
- **Ask for the states you're missing.** One round: "Can you send the empty
  state, the error state, and the mobile width for this screen?" is a far better
  use of a question than guessing.
- Screenshots are usually the *happy path with good data*. Assume state coverage
  is unaudited until you see otherwise, and say so.

## Source 4 — source code

Excellent for structure, tokens, semantics, and what states *exist*. Weak for
what any of it looks like or feels like.

### The read-before-you-judge inventory

Find these before writing findings. They are the system the product actually
has, and D10 is graded against *it*, not against any ideal:

| What | Where to look | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| **Design tokens** | `tailwind.config.*` (`theme.extend`), CSS custom properties in `globals.css`/`:root`, a `tokens.*`/`theme.*` file, a Figma-exported JSON | D10 |
| **Styling approach** | Tailwind · CSS Modules · styled-components/emotion · vanilla-extract · plain CSS. More than one in active use is itself a finding | D10 |
| **Component library** | shadcn/ui (`components/ui/` + `components.json`), Radix, MUI, Chakra, Mantine — or bespoke/hand-rolled with no library behind it | D10, D12 |
| **Icon set** | A real library (`lucide-react`, `@phosphor-icons/*`, `react-icons`) vs hand-drawn inline `<svg>` with inconsistent stroke and size | D10 |
| **Charts / data-viz** | Recharts, visx, Chart.js, D3, tremor — or hand-coded SVG/canvas/divs | D11 |
| **Fonts** | `next/font`, `@font-face`, a Google Fonts link; whether `tabular-nums` appears anywhere | D10, D11 |
| **Motion** | framer-motion/`motion`, react-spring, Reanimated, or CSS transitions — and whether `prefers-reduced-motion` is handled anywhere | D12 |
| **Dark/light** | `next-themes`, a `data-theme`/`.dark` strategy, or none | D9, D12 |
| **Routes** | The route tree / navigator config — the IA as built | D2 |
| **Copy strings** | i18n files, or strings inline in components | D8 |
| **A11y attributes** | `aria-*`, `role`, `alt`, `<label>` association, focus management, `tabIndex` | D12 |
| **State branches** | Does each async view have `isLoading` / `isError` / empty branches, or only the success render? | D7 |

**Then read two or three neighbouring components.** They teach the local dialect
— naming, variant expression, how much abstraction the team tolerates — and that
dialect is the baseline for every consistency judgment you make.

### What code evidence can and cannot support

- **Can, at `Observed`:** a missing `alt`, a `<div onClick>` with no role or key
  handler, a hard-coded `#3B82F6` where tokens exist, an async view with no
  error branch, a form with no `<label>`, a `100vh` on a mobile layout.
- **Only `Inferred`:** anything about rendered appearance, contrast (computed
  colors may cascade), focus visibility (a global reset may kill it or a `:focus-
  visible` rule may restore it), perceived performance, whether the empty state
  a branch renders is any good.
- **Never:** "users are confused by this" from code alone.

Cite `file.tsx:42`. A code finding without a line number is half a finding.

---

## Source 5 — verbal description only

The weakest input, and the one most likely to produce a confident-sounding
audit about a product that doesn't exist.

- **Everything is `Hypothesis`.** No exceptions, no "well, they clearly meant".
- **Phrase findings as questions**, and put them in the report's §6 Open
  questions, not in the findings tables: "If the confirmation step shows only
  the total and not the line items, users can't catch a wrong quantity before
  paying — does it show line items?"
- **Say it once, at the top**, plainly: this is a review of a described product,
  the findings are hypotheses, and they need ten minutes with the real thing to
  become findings.
- **Push once for anything better.** A single screenshot moves more findings to
  `Observed` than an hour of reasoning from a description.

A verbal-only audit is legitimate work — it can surface the right questions and
the known-risky patterns. It is not legitimate to present it as an audit of what
shipped.

---

## Mixing sources

Common and good: code plus a live URL, or Figma plus screenshots.

- **Confidence is per finding, from the evidence behind *that* finding** — not a
  session-wide setting. A code-derived missing-`alt` is `Observed` in the same
  report where a flow-order claim is `Inferred`.
- **When sources disagree, that is itself a finding.** Figma shows an error
  state the code has no branch for; the design system defines four text tokens
  and the code uses eleven greys. Design/build drift is a real D10 defect —
  report it as one, with both locations.
- **Prefer the live product for anything about behavior**, the code for anything
  about semantics and tokens, Figma for anything about intent.

## When there is nothing usable

Ask, **once**, for the minimum that unblocks a real audit — and make the ask
specific enough to be answerable in one message:

> To audit this properly I need three things:
> 1. **Scope** — the whole product, one flow, or one screen? Any dimension you
>    especially care about (accessibility, conversion, consistency)?
> 2. **Access** — a URL I can browse, a Figma link, screenshots of the key
>    screens, or the repo path. Any one of these works; more is better.
> 3. **Audience** — who uses this, and are they expert users of the domain or
>    the general public?
>
> If you can also send the empty, error, and mobile states of the main screen,
> that covers most of what usually goes unchecked.

**Attach each evidence option's confidence ceiling to the option itself.** The
person choosing is the only one who can go and get better evidence, and they
will only do it if they know what the cheap answer costs. Say it in the question,
not later in the report:

- **Live URL** — highest confidence: real states, real copy, real focus order.
- **Repo path** — structure, tokens, and accessibility attributes; **rendering
  has to be inferred**.
- **Figma link** — design intent and tokens; **runtime behaviour inferred**.
- **Screenshots** — audited in frame, and explicitly not beyond it.
- **A description** — hypotheses only, no observations at all.

"Live URL" next to "highest confidence" is what turns a screenshot into a URL.
A ceiling explained only after the report is written teaches nobody anything.

**If the ask renders as a structured picker, it is capped at four questions.**
Take **evidence · mode · platform · audience** — evidence because nothing works
without it, audience because it has the widest blast radius, platform because it
selects a reference file, mode because it sets the depth. **Scope is the one
that gets dropped**, so state your reading of it back in the first sentence of
your reply and invite the correction there — early enough to be cheap, rather
than discovering at the end that they wanted one screen.

Then work with whatever comes back — including nothing, in which case run the
description-only path and be explicit about it. **Do not ask a second round.**
An audit that arrives late because it interviewed the user three times has
already lost.

## Do / Don't

- DO keep a SEEN / NOT SEEN log from the first minute; it becomes §Scope.
- DO record conditions (viewport, auth, data state), not just page names.
- DO drive the product — tab through it, break it, empty it, overflow it —
  rather than only looking at it.
- DO run `get_metadata` first in Figma, then work from specific `nodeId`s.
- DO fall back to `get_design_context` with a `nodeId` when a screenshot returns
  empty; DON'T retry the screenshot repeatedly.
- DO treat a Figma file as intent, and say when a finding is about the design
  rather than the build.
- DO quote exact labels, error strings, and file:line.
- DO report design/build disagreement as a finding in its own right.
- DON'T fetch Figma CDN assets with curl — they're signed and short-lived.
- DON'T treat a missing frame in Figma as proof of a missing state.
- DON'T extrapolate past the edge of a screenshot.
- DON'T upgrade confidence because a finding feels obviously true.
- DON'T ask more than one round of intake questions.
